# Challenges Encountered
## Challenge 1:  
**Date:** [05/10/2023]
**Issue:** [having the inability to gather all data for some of the named places.]
**Description:** [The cafe's we gathered data from were either part of a chain or part of their own franchise.]

## Challenge 2:
**Date:** [05/10/2023]
**Issue:** [employees unaware of if the establishment had Social media or a phone number.]
**Description:** [when asking questions relating to ecieving answers for the data, some emplopees couldnt give us an answer as they were unaware themselves of one.]

# Solutions and Workarounds
## Challenge 1 (Continued):
**Date:** [05/10/2023]
**Solution:** [we attempted to amend this, by gathering data on more than minimum 5 places originally selected to compensate for the lack of data in the section for Phone number data.]

## Challenge 2 (Continued):
**Date:** [05/10/2023]
**Solution:** [We ended up searching the establishments up on Google to see primarily if the cafe had a Phone number or Social media, with only the latter being successful when possible.]

# Insights and Observations
[All data collected from cafes which were parts of chain, being 2 through 7, were present on a social media platform, being Instagram; however they did not have any personal phone numbers for their place of work, unlike 8 which was a franchise cafe, having only a phone number and no social media precence. Beanbury, the only other franchise, unforunately had neither. 8 was the only establishment to give the phone number which was positioned below the name of the cafe on the front of the building allowing for easy access.]

# Personal Reflections
[It is unfortunate that the data for all cafes in this project didnt have all boxes ticked, giving an answer to all the questions we set out to find, however this didnt discourage the objective of exploring and applying said data in this project and so the goal overall was successful.]

# Conclusion
[Not all data can be found through primary research and so secondary research should always be used in parallel to support and provide evidence for data where neccessary. The collection of data can be streamlined thoroughly when an objective with data types is planned out ahead allowing for succesive data to follow in the selected fields, so the original objective can be accomplished.]
