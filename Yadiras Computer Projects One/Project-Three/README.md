# Emoji

## Introduction
This project sees us drawing an emoji using shapes that we've learned about in this unit. The challenge is to make this emoji dynamic, integrating both built-in and custom variables into our design.

## What Have I Produced?
- **Description of the Project:** This project shows my skills on using shapes in P5 js, it shows a monobrow design inspired by the father from the animated film "Cloudy with a chance of meatballs" by using rectangles and ellipses.

- **Key Features:** it uses both constants and variables to create the image, being to place the image in the centre with both height and width /2. This emoji code also uses random to give some interactivity for the user, giving a random monobrow size on the emoji each time play is pressed.

## My Coding Experience

- **Thinking:** small sketches of unused emojis, developing into the basic yellow face on P5 JS being coded with the monobrow being added above that, with the eyes being altered to appear like shadows.
- **Reading:** for this project I looked at my previous work done in class and used that code to translate into this product.
- **Copying and Modifying:** I used my previous code I did on shapes, so that I could format my work more easily, as well as edit the work much more quickly.
- **Writing Code:** I used var before setup so that it would work in the draw function, as well as using random in the setup so I could call it in draw. I also wrote the code so that each layer would work accordingly and not overlap incorrectly, so that it would still look like an emoji.
- **Challenges and Learnings:** to place the emoji in the centre of the screen alongside making sure all components fit on the yellow circle, I did this by using simple math to make sure all parts are even and fit accordingly. I also struggled with using the random function, as I kept calling it from draw whilt writing the code calling it in draw. after looking back to my previous P5 JS work I saw how I used var before outside both functions, as well writing the values for the random range in the setupwhich I then used correctly producing the size altering monbrow on top of the emoji face. 

## Technologies Used
